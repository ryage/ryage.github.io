一个还没弄清楚的问题就是，我怎样可以让世界变得更好。

第一个问题：怎样定义“更好”？

更少饥饿，战乱，疾病，或者说更少人受苦。
人们试图理解并接纳而不是攻击与自己不同的人，寻求真相与真理而不是契合自己成见的谣言.
国家之间相互合作，共同发展，而不是将别的国家塑造成敌人来转移国内矛盾。

...

第二个问题：如何实现？

虽然不知道如何实现（上面那个还能胡诌一点，这个真不知道），但是看起来没有一点是可以通过埋头搬砖实现的。我并不会定期地和朋友聊天，也没有在任一社交平台（微博/知乎）输出高质量有价值的内容，甚至连和父母的交流也只是等他们打电话给我。这样下去，看来是不太行了。

（未完待续）

One question of which I don't know the answer yet, is that how I can make the world a better place. 

The first question is how I define "better". 

People try to understand and accept rather than attack people who are different from themselves. People seek truth and fact rather than rumours that fit their own preconceived notions.

Countries cooperate with each other and develop together, rather than deflecting domestic conflicts by branding other countries as enemies.

The second question is how to achieve it. 

I don't know how to do it (the answer to the first question can still be made up a little bit, this one I really have no idea), but it seems that none of the goals can be achieved by working with my head down. I don't regularly chat with my friends, I don't produce content with high quality and value on any of the social platforms (e.g. Weibo / Zhihu), and even the communication with my parents is just waiting for them to call me. If I go on like this I will get nowhere.
