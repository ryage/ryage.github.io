一个还没弄清楚的问题就是，我怎样可以让世界变得更好。

第一个问题：怎样定义“更好”？

更少饥饿，战乱，疾病，或者说更少人受苦。
人们试图理解并接纳而不是攻击与自己不同的人，寻求真相与真理而不是契合自己成见的谣言.
国家之间相互合作，共同发展，而不是将别的国家塑造成敌人来转移国内矛盾。


One question of which I don't know the answer yet, is that how I can make the world a better place. 

The first part of that is how I define "better". 

People try to understand and accept rather than attack people who are different from themselves. People seek truth and fact rather than rumours that fit their own preconceived notions.

Countries cooperate with each other and develop together, rather than deflecting domestic conflicts by branding other countries as enemies.
